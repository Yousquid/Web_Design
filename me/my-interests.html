                <p>As a game designer, I like playing games. However, I have to answer the question many peopple might ask first: what is my favorite game? The answer is, no, I don't have a favorite game, but I do have a list of the games that might potentially be my favorite game. Here, I just want to list some games that I really enjoy playing together with my friends.</p>
                <p>Terraria</p>

                <p>I have a song that I really like and want to share here: Susan Shuo.</p>

            </figure>
                <p> I like this song because it incorporates the tradition Chinese opera "Susan Qi Jie" with RMB elements so well in both musical and lyrical aspects. I think this song is insanely cool and good!</p>
