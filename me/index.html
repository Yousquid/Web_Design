                <p>I am Andson, I am from China. I major in Game Design in Tisch. Though Game design belongs to the Tisch, our actual main campus is located at the Brooklyn, the 370 Jay Street Center. I am a junior student now. Specifically, when working on game projects, I am the game designer who works on designing the mechanics and rules of the game.</p>

                <p>About my personality, I would say that I am a person who does not like to talk much. However, the silence is just for the regular me, I can talk a lot about the game design when it comes to the specific games. Moreover, actually, I think I am good at making presentations, which might initially be taken as something uncommon for a guy who is a bit shy and silent, but I am not lying, this is true about me!</p>
